### Ideas
* __Melody and Rhythm:__ can be trained using MIDI data sets in order to generate melody and time.
* __Lyrics:__ can be trained on any corpus of text to generate lyrics.
* __Synthetic Voice:__ can use WaveNet to generate voice?
* multiple models...

### Notes
using the (__Lakh MIDI Dataset__)[http://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/]
